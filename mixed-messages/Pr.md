# Project Objectives

 1. Build a message generator program using JavaScript
 2. Use Git version control
 3. Use command line
 4. Develop locally on your computer

#### Plans

    1. Implementing quote database to draw from
        +Array of objects, that include keys of 'quote' and 'quoted' a function to randomly select an array item. Include a function in the object that determines quote length/amount of words
    2. Constructing a 'mixed message' using quote database
        +Function to randomly select a portion of that quote, by choosing a starting point and ending point within the bounds of the quote, minimum of one word long
        +Function to concatinate at least three, but up to 6 (arbitrary I know), instances of this. 
    3. Recalling data about the quotes
        +If ambitious, make a function that will print data about the quote you generated, using the object values of the originial quotes.
